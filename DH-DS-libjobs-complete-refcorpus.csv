UCLA ranks tenth in the Times of London Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, twelfth in the Academic Ranking of World Universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and fifth in the U.S. by Washington Monthly. The National Research Council ranks forty of its graduate and doctoral research programs among its top ten.To enable these accomplished students, faculty, and staff to create, disseminate, and apply knowledge for the benefit of global society, the UCLA Library is re-envisioning how it is acquired, synthesized, and shared across academic audiences and with the public. It was among the first academic libraries to develop subject-specialist librarians and to launch a program to enhance students' research skills. Its Special Collections pioneered the acquisition by public institutions of rare and unique books, children's literature, pulp and detective fiction, works by or about women and minorities, screenplays, architectural plans, and Los Angeles-related materials and today leads the way in collecting archival resources in digital format such as emails and manuscripts. It has launched innovative data management services and an affordable course materials initiative that have served as models for other libraries.The Library serves UCLA students, faculty, and staff whenever and wherever they need its resources and expertise. Reconfigured, high-tech spaces and services in its ten campus libraries enable users and librarians to explore and work with print and digital materials collaboratively or individually, pursue new lines of inquiry, and develop new pedagogical approaches as well as novel forms of scholarship. More than 3.5 million people visit annually, while an additional 3.4 million visitors enter online through its virtual front doors.Whether on campus or online, the Library forms the intellectual heart of UCLA, a hub for cutting-edge discovery, scholarship, and instruction.The Louise M.

629,13-May-16,"The Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has an opening for a Program Manager within a newly funded project supported by the Mellon Foundation. The goal of Linked Data for Production will be to begin the transition of traditional technical services workflows to ones rooted in linked data. The Program Manager will be key in coordinating the efforts of the LD4P members and integration of the program with the outside community.This is a two-year, fixed-term position with the possibility of an extension.Linked Data for Production: Linked Data for Production (LD4P) is a collaboration between six institutions (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Library of Congress, Princeton, and Stanford University) to begin the transition of technical services production workflows to ones based in Linked Open Data (LOD). This first phase of the transition focuses on the development of the ability to produce metadata as LOD communally, the enhancement of the BIBFRAME ontology to encompass the multiple resource formats that academic libraries must process, and the engagement of the broader academic library community to ensure a sustainable and extensible environment. As its name implies, LD4P is focused on the immediate needs of metadata production such as ontology coverage and workflow transition. The LD4P partners' work will be based, in part, on a collection of tools that currently exist, such as those developed by the Library of Congress (used by LC and Stanford) and Vitro (developed by Cornell and used by Cornell and Columbia). The cyclical feedback of use and enhancement request to the developers of these tools will allow for their enhancement based on use in an actual production environment. This development cycle will help LD4P build a durable, sustainable, flexible, toolkit that will meet long- and short-term needs.LD4P Program: The LD4P Program will be the overarching project tying together the linked-data representation of the inter-institutional workflows, procedures, and data sharing of the individual members of LD4P. In addition, the Program will be the bridge between LD4P and the broader metadata community. The goals of the project are three:* Reinvent metadata production for any resource a library curates making use of linked data in a cooperative, distributed environment* Essential tool and system configuration to pilot this metadata production* Develop a community/collaborative framework for coordinating the ontology and technical workKey to the community outreach aspect of this program will be outreach to the vendor community that supports the mission of academic libraries (metadata suppliers, authority vendors, the ILS, etc.). There will also be an inner circle of closely related linked-data projects whose efforts should be coordinated with LD4P. Through active participation at LD4P meetings, the project wiki, and email listserves, this close circle of related projects will be able to mutually monitor and engage in each other's progress. The LD4P Program will consist of a LD4P Program Manager, LD4P Program Technologist and Community Engagement.LD4P Program Manager: The LD4P Program Manager will be key to LD4P's success. Each of the six institutions involved in LD4P will be working in separate subject domains. Each institution will be developing its own local infrastructure based on local strengths and needs. Key to success will be the development and sharing of standard procedures and protocols across institutions. In addition to these, there will be overarching agreements in a cooperative cataloging environment, such as identity management and persistence, which will need to be developed and maintained.Job Purpose: The LD4P Program Manager (PM) will be responsible for the management of this complex project together with the monitoring of the individual institutional projects to facilitate their timely completion. The duties will include facilitation of the identification of and convergence on common strategies, procedures, tools, and approaches as similar work is performed at individual institutions and the creation of documentation (such as vendor requirements for various LOD library services, best practices, how to-s, FAQs, and other guides for the Library community), on behalf of the project as a wholeThe PM will be the project's liaison to external LOD projects and library vendors to further the goals of the project and raise awareness of the activities of LD4P as a whole. In addition, the PM works closely with the LD4P Program Technologist and the Digital Library Systems and Services (DLSS) staff to further internal goals.Last, the PM will be responsible for the convening of project meetings, organization of workshops, and presentation of LD4P progress at select national and international meetings.","Qualifications Minimum Education and Experience Required:*	Bachelor's degree in a related field and five years of related experience in management of projects with extensive size/complexity and moderate performance risk, including project planning, scheduling, tracking, and budgeting, or a combination of education and experience.*	Relevant experience/education may include:o	Thorough familiarity with the library environment, language and cultureo	Theoretical knowledge of current cataloging procedures and principles as defined in RDA, AACR2, MARC Bibliographic, Holdings, and Authorities formats.o	Experience with principles of authority control, including selecting and applying controlled vocabularies and ontologies. o	Knowledge of existing and emerging metadata standards, such as Dublin Core, EAD, MODS, METS, OAI, TEI, XML, and relevant thesauri or ontologies, as required by special projects.o	Proven knowledge of traditional library metadata, structure, and function in the ILSo	Demonstrated expertise with effective use of RDFMinimum Knowledge, Skills and Abilities Required:*	Highly effective written and oral communication skills to address a wide variety of audiences.*	Ability to productively assemble, engage, and lead cross-functional teams.*	Demonstrated project management ability to employ integration, scope time management, cost, quality, human resources, communications, risk, and procurement components.*	Ability to balance member expectations with project reality.*	Demonstrated resilience, diplomacy, influence, relationship building, and problem solving skills in a variety of situations.*	Keen grasp of interpersonal and impact awareness.*	Depth of knowledge in technical discipline/domain needed to deliver projects.Physical Requirements:*	Frequently sit, perform desk based computer tasks, and grasp lightly/fine manipulation and lift/carry/push/pull objects that weigh up to ten pounds.*	Occasionally stand/walk, use telephone.*	Rarely crawl, climb ladders, twist/bend/stoop/squat, reach/work above shoulder, grasp forcefully.",,"Core Duties:*	Perform the full range of the project management cycle: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.

From its beautiful neighborhood campus in a uniquely diverse and vibrant city on the Pacific Rim, teaching and research extend beyond the classroom, office, and lab through active engagement with communities, organizations, projects, and partnerships throughout the region and around the world.UCLA's diverse community of scholars encompasses nearly 30,000 undergraduates pursuing 125 majors, 13,000 graduate students in fifty-nine research programs, and 4,000 faculty members including Nobel Laureates; Rhodes Scholars; MacArthur Fellows; winners of the Fields Medal, National Medal of Science, Pritzer Prize, and Pulitzer Prize; and recipients of Oscars, Emmys, Tonys, and Golden Globes.

It was among the first academic libraries to develop subject-specialist librarians and to launch a program to enhance students' research skills. Its Special Collections pioneered the acquisition by public institutions of rare and unique books, children's literature, pulp and detective fiction, works by or about women and minorities, screenplays, architectural plans, and Los Angeles-related materials and today leads the way in collecting archival resources in digital format such as emails and manuscripts. It has launched innovative data management services and an affordable course materials initiative that have served as models for other libraries.The Library serves UCLA students, faculty, and staff whenever and wherever they need its resources and expertise. Reconfigured, high-tech spaces and services in its ten campus libraries enable users and librarians to explore and work with print and digital materials collaboratively or individually, pursue new lines of inquiry, and develop new pedagogical approaches as well as novel forms of scholarship. More than 3.5 million people visit annually, while an additional 3.4 million visitors enter online through its virtual front doors.Whether on campus or online, the Library forms the intellectual heart of UCLA, a hub for cutting-edge discovery, scholarship, and instruction.The Louise M.
