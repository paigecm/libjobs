Newly-degreed librarians are welcomed and strongly encouraged to apply.As a member of the University faculty, the Library Fellow should be interested in working at a university engaged with issues in Christian higher education and the Lutheran tradition. She or he will also demonstrate a commitment to cultural diversity and the ability to work with individuals or groups from diverse backgrounds. The Library Fellow will benefit from immediate opportunities in scholarly and professional development, faculty governance of the library, library policy creation, and service on library and campus committees and task forces. Current library faculty are engaged in a wide range of professional and campus-related activities, from embedded librarianship to scholarly communication initiatives, from writing-across-the-curriculum programming to changing service models, and welcome a new colleague's interests and insights."

In consultation with the Director of Library Research Services, and other librarians as appropriate, the Library Fellow will begin to develop an original research project, one which can be conducted during the fellowship, culminating in a presentation or peer-reviewed publication. Also across both years, the Library Fellow will have the opportunity to partner with another librarian as a subject liaison to an academic program. Liaison work includes providing specialized student information literacy instruction and consultation, collaborating with disciplinary faculty, and working with collections and information resources in specific subject areas."
