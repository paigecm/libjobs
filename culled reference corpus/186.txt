"The Ohio State University Libraries is looking for recent library school graduates to join us in a unique two-year residency program. In 2015 - 2016, the program will place three residents in rich opportunities to advance innovative approaches, fill gaps, promote collaboration, and facilitate recruitment of under-represented backgrounds. Residents will gain practical work experience as an academic librarian with visiting faculty status and have the opportunity to make significant contributions to one of these dynamic, evolving opportunities:Diversity Resident: Metadata TransformationDiversity Resident: Digital Research Services for the Arts and HumanitiesDiversity Resident: Latin American Studies"





"The residents will participate in professional development workshops, conferences, and institutes and will serve on Libraries' committees. As a cohort, these individuals will be learning and working together, which will result in unanticipated connections and solutions. Each resident will be working to expose distinctive collections and advancing digitally-enabled support for teaching, learning and research. The residents will push at the edge of current ways of working in academic libraries and lead colleagues in thinking about new avenues for supporting scholarship and discovery. Consider us!"
