Libraries faculty and staff are deeply involved in information literacy instruction and instructional design, re-defining of learning spaces, scholarly communication, data management, and global outreach. PUL has embarked upon a comprehensive program to engage in campus learning initiatives, including the development of information literacy instruction, course-redesign initiatives advancing active learning on campus, and the design and implementation of dynamic new learning spaces.Purdue Libraries faculty have been expanding their collaborative endeavors with disciplinary faculty in integrating information literacy into the curriculum, culminating in 2012 with a core campus curriculum that includes information literacy as a core requirement. PUL is also home to the first endowed chair in information literacy in the United States, established in 2008.A reconceptualization of spaces is taking place throughout PUL. The recently renovated Roland G. Parrish Library of Management and Economics is a natural extension of the classroom, redesigned with input from students. The renovation of the Hicks Undergraduate Library completed in 2014 includes three active learning classrooms in support of Purdue's campus wide, innovative course-redesign initiative. Construction is now underway on the Active Learning Center, which will bring together six science and engineering libraries into a building that will seamlessly integrate learning and classroom spaces in a $79M facility at the very heart of the campus.Libraries faculty and staff also collaborate with disciplinary faculty to develop new approaches for discovering, accessing, and sharing of research publications and data. Purdue Libraries are leaders in the areas of data curation and library publishing services. Accomplishments in data curation include the development of the Data Curation Profiles Toolkit, an instrument for assessing the data needs of faculty researchers. The Purdue University Research Repository (PURR), a Libraries initiative, provides an online, collaborative working space and data-sharing platform to support the data management needs of Purdue researchers and their collaborators.Since 2005, Purdue Libraries has collaborated in interdisciplinary sponsored research on campus with over 100 faculty, as well as partners at other libraries and institutions.
